## FAQ

- Why port 81?
  - Sometimes you want your backend and frontend separated. You can have your frontend runs in the default `:80` and the API to be in port `:81`
  
- Can we change this port?
  - Yes. You can change the port in the webserver block of the `docker-compose.yml` file
  
- Is everything customizable?
  - Yes. You can fiddle the `docker-compose.yml` file and make your own customization. Be sure you know what you are doing.
